#### Hey, I'm Reece! üëã

I'm an aspired web developer and software engineer based in Lancashire, England. I have a passion to create services and applications that both developers and everyday people can use, You can find all my current RoadMap [üéØhere](https://github.com/users/NotReeceHarris/projects/4).

I started my own tech development startup to bring not just my ideas to life but others too, This company is called techonaut and you can find us [here](https://techonaut.tech/).

Other passions are a game design I would love to create worlds inspired by my creation and dreams bring my thoughts to life, I have experience with UE4 and blender.
