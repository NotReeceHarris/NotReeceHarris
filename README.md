**Hey, I'm Reece! üëã**

I'm an aspired web developer and software engineer based in Lancashire, England. I have a passion to create services and applications that both developers and everyday people can use, You can find all my current projects [üéØhere](https://github.com/users/NotReeceHarris/projects/4).

Currently I'm using python to get nearly expert level however I also know PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, TS, JS, SASS and I can learn and manipulate nearly any langauge as I am a fast learner.

In my free time I also dabble with graphic design as a hobby however you can also find me playing games, driving around, exploring, spending time with friends and family üôÇ.
