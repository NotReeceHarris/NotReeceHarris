#### Hey, I'm Reece! ðŸ‘‹

I like to say I'm a software engineer, The only issue is I have hundreds of ideas and limited time to do them. I start a project and 2 weeks later start another however I will come back to past projects or let the community contribute.

I find interest in trying different technologies and creating my systems, Areas I have dabbled in are Ethical Hacking, Cyber Security, Networking, Encryption, Operating systems, Web Development, Data Analysis, Data Storage and much more.
